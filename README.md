This project is a real-time, interactive web dashboard for the game "Grow a Garden". Built entirely in **R** and the **Shiny** framework, this application pulls live data to help players track valuable in-game assets, monitor time-sensitive events, and make informed decisions without needing to be actively in the game.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This application is powered by the R ecosystem, demonstrating a modern, modularized approach to Shiny development.

-   **Core Framework:** **R** & **Shiny**
-   **UI / Layout:** **shinydashboard** combined with custom HTML/CSS located in the `www/` directory for unique styling and mobile responsiveness.
-   **Data Handling:**
    -   **API Interaction:** `{httr}` or `{httr2}` for fetching live game data.
    -   **Data Caching:** Caches API data to an `.rds` file (`api_data_cache.rds`) to minimize requests and improve performance.
    -   **Data Manipulation:** `{dplyr}`, `{readr}` for cleaning and processing data from both the API and static `.csv` files.
    -   **Time/Date:** `{lubridate}` for handling timers and timestamps.
-   **Modularity:** The application is broken into **Shiny Modules** (`calculator_module.R`, `encyclopedia_module.R`, `history_module.R`) for better organization, scalability, and code management.
-   **Deployment:** Hosted on **shinyapps.io**.
