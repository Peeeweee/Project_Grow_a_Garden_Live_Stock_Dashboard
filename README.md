This project is a comprehensive R Shiny web application designed for players of the Roblox game "Grow a Garden". It provides a real-time, interactive dashboard to monitor in-game data, helping players make informed decisions about buying, selling, and trading.

The dashboard pulls live information from various APIs and community-run websites to display current shop inventories, restock timers, and active weather events. It also features powerful tools like a fruit value calculator and a detailed in-game encyclopedia.

*   **Key R Packages:**
    *   `httr` & `jsonlite`: For interacting with live game APIs.
    *   `rvest` & `xml2`: For web scraping data from community wikis.
    *   `dplyr`, `purrr`, `stringr`: For efficient and modern data manipulation.
    *   `DT`: For creating beautiful, interactive data tables.

## ‚ú® Features

The application is divided into four main modules:

### 1. Live Dashboard
The central hub for real-time game information.
*   **Real-time Stock Tracking:** Displays the current items and quantities available in all major in-game shops (Seeds, Gear, Eggs, Honey, Cosmetics, Night).
*   **Dynamic Countdown Timers:** Shows live countdowns for when each shop is due to restock.
*   **Smart Auto-Refresh:** The app automatically refreshes data when timers hit zero and at strategic mid-cycle points to catch early stock changes.
*   **Interactive UI:** Click on a timer to automatically scroll down to its corresponding stock section.
*   **Weather Monitoring:** Reports the current in-game weather, which affects crop growth, with custom icons and colors for each event.

### 2. Stock History Viewer
A tool to look back at past shop inventories.
*   **Data Logging:** Logs every fetched stock update to a local CSV file for historical analysis.
*   **Interactive Viewer:** Allows users to select any previously recorded timestamp from a dropdown and see a complete snapshot of the shops at that moment.

### 3. Fruit Value Calculator
A powerful tool to calculate the final sell price of any crop.
*   **Dynamic Calculation:** Users can select a base crop and apply various in-game mutations (Growth, Temperature, Environmental) to see the final value based on the official formula.
*   **Live Data Fetching:** Includes a "Fetch Latest" button to update crop base values from community sources.
*   **Transparent Formula:** Shows the breakdown of the calculation for clarity.

### 4. Comprehensive Encyclopedia
A one-stop reference for all in-game items, scraped from community wikis.
*   **Categorized Information:** Organized into searchable and sortable tabs for:
    *   Seeds & Crops
    *   Gear & Tools
    *   Eggs & Hatchable Pets
    *   Weather & Mutations
*   **Robust & Resilient:** Features a fallback system that uses a cached HTML file to display data if the primary live API is down, ensuring the app remains functional.
